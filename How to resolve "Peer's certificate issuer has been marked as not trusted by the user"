In order to resolve the issue, below are the step by step process:
  1. Performed the following steps on the affected host to fix the "Peer's certificate issuer has been marked as not trusted by the user.", 
     which the customer was getting during installation of the package.

     # export KATELLO=$(rpm -qa | grep katello-ca-consumer)
     # rpm -e $KATELLO
     # yum localinstall http://satellite.example.com/pub/katello-ca-consumer-latest.noarch.rpm
     # yum install leapp


  2. After performing step 1 we found out that the host was registered with the RHEL7 content view, which has only RHEL7 repositories available, but to perform the
     leapp upgrade, we should have the RHEL8.10 repositories in the associated content view.

     # subscription-manager remove --all
     # subscription-manager unregister
     # subscription-manager clean
     # yum clean all
 
     #in the example below the Activation Key can be changed to any RHEL 8 Content View
      that has been set up if there is a team specific CV

     # subscription-manager register --org="IaaS_Org" --activationkey="iaas-rhel8" 
     # subscription-manager refresh 

     After we re-register the problematic host, and then RHEL8.10 repositories were available to perform the leapp upgrade.
